# VBA-challenge
Challenge Modulo 2
This is the challenge of module 2, to carry out this challenge I have used the material given in the Bootcamp classes.

# Instructions

1) Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
2) The ticker symbol
3) Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
4) The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
5) Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
6) Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
